## 📍 Overview

<code>❯ This project simulates the DNA of a mysterious organism, **Pila aequor (P. aequor)**, discovered near hydrothermal vents. Due to the organism's unstable environment, its DNA mutates frequently, making it an interesting specimen for research. Your task is to create multiple instances of **P. aequor**, allowing for DNA mutation simulation, survival probability determination, and comparison of DNA sequences.</code>

---

## 👾 Features

<code>❯ Key features of the Mysterious Organism project include:</code>

- Create organisms with unique DNA strands composed of 15 bases.
- Simulate DNA mutations for the organisms.
- Compare DNA sequences between organisms to check for commonality.
- Determine the organism's likelihood of survival based on its DNA composition.
- Generate complementary DNA strands.
- Create 30 organisms that have a higher likelihood of survival.
